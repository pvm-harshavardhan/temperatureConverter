# Temperature Converter Project

The Temperature Converter project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application enables users to convert temperature readings between three basic temperature scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

Users can input a temperature value in any of the supported scales and instantly see its equivalent values in the other two scales. The intuitive interface makes it easy for users to perform temperature conversions efficiently.
